# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-mobile-infrastructure-data-layer-and-navigation-skeleton (2026-05-06)

- Placeholder screens hard-code magic colour strings (`'#080808'`, `'#FFFFFF'`) instead of `Colors.*` tokens. Low priority since these are stubs; update when screens get real UI.
- No `gcTime` set on `queryClient`. All queries are currently disabled (`enabled: false`); revisit when real query implementations land in Epic 5.
- `catalog/[fixtureId].tsx` path with square brackets may cause issues on Windows CI agents. Not a concern on current macOS/Linux stack.
